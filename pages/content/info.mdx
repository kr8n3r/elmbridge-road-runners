Elmbridge Road Runners are a small friendly road running club based at the Elmbridge Canoe Club, in Walton Lane, Weybridge, Surrey.
There are around 120 members, both male and female, of mixed ability.

Membership is just Â£35 per annum which allows use of the Canoe Club House and all the facilities (showers, kitchen etc.) You are welcome to join us for 2-3 runs with no commitment to join, just turn up and say hello to anyone who looks like a runner.

Club nights are Tuesday and Thursday at 7:00 p.m. Some nights we just jog around the streets or on the river towpath and on the first Tuesday each month a group may do an interval or hill session - these sessions are open to runners of all speeds and abilities.

In the Winter, both club nights are at the Canoe Club from where members typically run 5 to 9 miles. 

During the summer, on Thursdays, we meet at West End (Esher) by the pond on the road to Garsons Farm and run in the woods. We also organise ad-hoc runs on weekends and holidays. 

The Winter sees us enter both mens and ladies teams in the Surrey Cross Country Leagues together with a variety of other cross country races. In the Summer we enter both mens and ladies teams in the Surrey Road League.

There are two club competitions during the year with trophies for the first three members in each competition. The Trophy Series, where members take part in some local races (Men's competition and Ladies competition), and the Handicap Series, which is on a fixed route on the towpath during the summer, on some of the Tuesday club nights (Men's competition and Ladies competition).
